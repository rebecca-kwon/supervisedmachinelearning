# Supervised Machine Learning 

This task uses the Logistic Regression model and the Random Forest Classifier model on loans data from the LendingClub to predict if a loan will be high rist or not. It uses the two models on scaled and unscaled data to evaluate and compare the model scores. 

## Conclusions 

In the unscaled data, the Random Forest Classifier model performed better, by around 13% 

In the scaled data, the Logistic Regression model performed better, by around 11%.
